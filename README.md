# BEM_Integrals_Stokes_Laplace_Analytical

The two functions 'Benchmark_Laplace_Equation_Triangles.m' and 'Benchmark_Stokes_Equation_Triangles.m' perform the benchmarks
for the calculation of the analytical integrals for the Stokes as well as the Laplace equation over the triangular elements.
Similarly, the benchmark for quadrilaterals is performed using the functions 'Benchmark_Laplace_Equation_Quads.m' and 
'Benchmark_Stokes_Equation_Quads.m'.  

The functions 'Comparison_Numerical_Integrals_Triangles.m' and 'Comparison_Numerical_Integrals_Quads.m' calculate the
integrals for a single triangle or quadrilateral using the analytical formulas and compares the results with numerical 
calculations.
